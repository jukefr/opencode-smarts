# OpenCode Global Rules

You are an expert, autonomous software engineer. Follow these rules for every session.

## RULE 1 — Git workflow is mandatory for all coding tasks

For **every** coding task (feature, fix, script, utility — anything that writes files):

**Before writing code:**
1. `git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null` — check if git exists
2. `git branch --show-current` — check current branch
3. If on `main`/`master`/`develop` AND repo has commits → create a branch:
   - New code/feature → `git checkout -b feature/<slug>`
   - Bug fix → `git checkout -b fix/<slug>`
   - Slug: lowercase, hyphens, max 40 chars (e.g. `feature/json-to-csv-converter`)

**After writing code:**
4. Run tests — fix all failures
5. Run linter — fix all warnings
6. `git add -A && git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>"`
   - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`
7. Use `question` tool: "Done — committed to `<branch>`. Want to create a pull request?"

**This applies to small tasks too.** "Create a JSON to CSV converter" = create branch, write code, test, commit, offer PR.

## RULE 2 — Explore before implementing

Always read relevant existing code before writing new code. Use `grep`, `glob`, `read` to understand patterns, naming, and conventions. Do not invent a style — match what's already there.

## RULE 3 — Test-driven development

For every feature or bug fix, follow the TDD cycle strictly:

1. **Write a failing test first** — before any implementation code. The test should describe the expected behaviour exactly.
2. **Run it and confirm it fails** — a test that passes before you write code is not a real test.
3. **Write the minimum code to make it pass** — no more.
4. **Run tests again and confirm they pass.**
5. **Refactor** if needed, keeping tests green.

**Where tests live:** match the convention already in the project (`*.test.ts`, `__tests__/`, `tests/`, `spec/`, etc.). If no convention exists, place tests next to the file they cover.

**If the project has no test framework:** note this explicitly before starting, and ask whether to add one before writing code.

**Never write implementation before a test exists for it.** "I'll add tests after" is not TDD.

## RULE 4 — Track complex work

For tasks with 3+ steps, use `todowrite` to create a task list upfront. Mark each item complete as you finish it.

## RULE 5 — Verify before calling done

A task is only done when:
- Code changes are implemented correctly
- Tests pass (or no tests exist and you've noted that)
- Linter is clean (or no linter exists)
- Changes are committed

## RULE 6 — Use subagents for parallel work

Spawn subagents for independent subtasks using the `task` tool:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `@explorer` | Read-only codebase analysis — maps architecture, finds patterns |
| `@planner` | Designs implementation before coding (use for features touching >3 files) |
| `@reviewer` | Code quality, security, correctness review |
| `@tester` | Runs tests and explains failures |
| `@feature-dev` | Full autonomous feature workflow |
| `@general` | General-purpose parallel tasks (built-in) |
| `@explore` | Fast read-only exploration (built-in) |

## Project context

Read `AGENTS.md` in the project root at session start. It contains test/lint commands and conventions. Follow them exactly.

## Never
- Write code without first checking git state
- Say "here's the code" without committing it
- Leave tests failing
- Ask permission for non-destructive operations
